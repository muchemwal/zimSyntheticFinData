# Zimbabwe Synthetic Financial Data

## About Dataset
### Context
This dataset can be used to calculate various evaluation metrics between original credit card fraud dataset and synthetic credit card fraud dataset.
Original dataset is highly imbalanced and this synthetic credit card dataset is balanced using transactions generated using CTGAN.
Content
This dataset consists of credit card transactions but generated using CTGAN so these transactions are not real. This CTGAN model is trained using original dataset - Credit Card Fraud Detection.
* Synthetic - 10 000 000 (Fraud and Real Transactions)
